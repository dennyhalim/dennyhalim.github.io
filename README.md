## Configuration

Everything that ends up on your page is driven by a single file: [`config.yml`](./config.yml). It's a Liquid-rendered YAML file with five top-level sections:

```yaml
theme: default                     # ← directory under ./themes/
lang: "en"

plugins:                           # ← optional dynamic data fetched at build time
  - GithubRepoStarsCountPlugin: [ZhgChgLi/linkyee]

title: "Your Name"                 # ← profile header
avatar: "./images/profile.jpeg"
name: "@yourhandle"
tagline: "One line about you."

links:                             # ← buttons in the link list
  - link:
      icon: "fa-brands fa-github"
      text: "GitHub ({{ vars.GithubRepoStarsCountPlugin['ZhgChgLi/linkyee'] }} ⭐)"
      url: "https://github.com/yourname"
      target: "_blank"

socials: [ ... ]                   # ← icon-only social row
footer: "Free-form HTML."
copyright: "© 2026 You."
```

The shipped [`config.yml`](./config.yml) is a fully working example that exercises **every built-in plugin** — read it as the canonical reference. Edit fields in place, push, wait for GitHub Actions to rebuild, refresh.

### Automatic redeployment

The site rebuilds automatically once a day so plugin output (star counts, latest posts, etc.) stays fresh. The cron lives in [`build.yml`](../../actions/workflows/build.yml):

```yaml
schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'   # daily at 00:00 UTC
```

Delete the `schedule:` block if you don't want scheduled redeploys.

---

## Themes 🎨

linkyee ships **8 built-in themes** designed to be drop-in usable. Switch by editing one line in `config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: minimal-mono   # any directory under ./themes/
```

| Slug | Light | Dark | Aesthetic / good for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | <img width="200" alt="default light" src="./themes/default/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="default dark" src="./themes/default/preview-dark.png"> | Clean cards · safe default for anyone |
| `minimal-mono` | <img width="200" alt="minimal-mono light" src="./themes/minimal-mono/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="minimal-mono dark" src="./themes/minimal-mono/preview-dark.png"> | Swiss minimal · monospace · engineers, writers |
| `editorial-serif` | <img width="200" alt="editorial-serif light" src="./themes/editorial-serif/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="editorial-serif dark" src="./themes/editorial-serif/preview-dark.png"> | Magazine serif · drop cap · bloggers, journalists |
| `neo-brutalism` | <img width="200" alt="neo-brutalism light" src="./themes/neo-brutalism/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="neo-brutalism dark" src="./themes/neo-brutalism/preview-dark.png"> | Thick borders · primary colors · indie devs, artists |
| `glassmorphism` | <img width="200" alt="glassmorphism light" src="./themes/glassmorphism/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="glassmorphism dark" src="./themes/glassmorphism/preview-dark.png"> | Frosted glass cards · designers, agencies |
| `paper-card` | <img width="200" alt="paper-card light" src="./themes/paper-card/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="paper-card dark" src="./themes/paper-card/preview-dark.png"> | Pastel cards · rounded · creators, illustrators |
| `newsprint` | <img width="200" alt="newsprint light" src="./themes/newsprint/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="newsprint dark" src="./themes/newsprint/preview-dark.png"> | Newspaper masthead · serif + mono · numbered link rows · the live look of [link.zhgchg.li](https://link.zhgchg.li/) |
| `terminal-retro` | <img width="200" alt="terminal-retro light" src="./themes/terminal-retro/preview-light.png"> | <img width="200" alt="terminal-retro dark" src="./themes/terminal-retro/preview-dark.png"> | CRT · scanlines · phosphor-green-on-black (dark) / olive-on-cream printer-paper (light) · hackers |

Every built-in theme meets the same baseline: WCAG AA contrast, **dark mode that auto-switches with your system appearance** (no manual toggle), responsive down to 320 px, keyboard-accessible focus states, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

To try them locally before committing, see [Local testing](#local-testing). To regenerate the preview screenshots above after any visual change, run `./scripts/screenshot-themes.sh` (requires `npx playwright`).

### Modifying a theme by hand

Each theme lives at `./themes/<theme-name>/` with three files:

- `index.html` — Liquid template (consumes `config.yml`)
- `styles.css` — the look
- `scripts.js` — can be empty, but the file must exist

The `default` theme self-hosts Font Awesome under `themes/default/fontawesome/`. The other built-ins load Font Awesome from a CDN to keep theme directories small.

### 🤖 AI Style Designer — generate a theme by description

Don't see a vibe you like? Describe it in plain English and the bundled [`linkyee-style-designer`](./.claude/skills/linkyee-style-designer/SKILL.md) Claude skill writes a full theme for you.

**How to use it:**

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) and open this repo with it.
2. Ask in natural language. Examples:

   > *"Design a linkyee theme inspired by 1960s Penguin paperback covers."*
   >
   > *"Make my links look like a Japanese ryokan website — quiet, elegant, lots of negative space."*
   >
   > *"I want a vaporwave aesthetic but keep it accessible."*
3. The skill reads your `config.yml`, asks clarifying questions if the brief is vague, generates `themes/<your-theme>/`, switches `theme:` in `config.yml`, and runs the build.
4. Run `./preview.sh <new-theme>` to see the result locally.

The skill enforces the same quality bar as the built-in themes: no AI slop (no unwarranted purple-pink gradients, no emoji-as-icons, no centered-everything-no-hierarchy), real typographic hierarchy, accessibility minimums, and **strict RWD** — mobile-first, ≥44 px tap targets, no horizontal scroll at 320 px.

**Deeper design tooling.** If you want a richer designer experience (multi-direction exploration, expert review, animation export), install the upstream [`huashu-design`](https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-design) skill alongside it. The linkyee skill defers to `huashu-design` when both are present.

## Plugins 🔌

Plugins are tiny Ruby classes that fetch data **at build time** and inject it into your page. Use them to render live values inside any link, the tagline, or the footer — anything that's a Liquid string.

### Built-in plugins

| Plugin | What it emits | Reference shape |
|---|---|---|
| `GithubRepoStarsCountPlugin` | Star count for one or more repos | `{{ vars.GithubRepoStarsCountPlugin['owner/repo'] }}` |
| `GithubLastCommitPlugin` | Latest commit `sha` / `date` / `message` | `{{ vars.GithubLastCommitPlugin['owner/repo'].date }}` |
| `GithubProfilePlugin` | `followers` / `following` / `repos` | `{{ vars.GithubProfilePlugin['user'].followers }}` |
| `RSSFeedPlugin` | Latest items (Medium / blog / podcast / YouTube feeds) | `{{ vars.RSSFeedPlugin['url'][0].title }}` |
| `CountdownPlugin` | Days until / since a target date | `{{ vars.CountdownPlugin.label.days }}` |
| `YouTubeChannelLatestVideoPlugin` | Latest video — title, URL, thumbnail | `{{ vars.YouTubeChannelLatestVideoPlugin['@handle'].title }}` |

Enable in `config.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - GithubRepoStarsCountPlugin:
      - ZhgChgLi/linkyee
  - RSSFeedPlugin:
      - https://yourblog.example/feed.xml
```

…then reference the result anywhere a Liquid string is rendered:

```yaml
links:
  - link:
      icon: "fa-brands fa-github"
      text: "linkyee ({{ vars.GithubRepoStarsCountPlugin['ZhgChgLi/linkyee'] }} ⭐)"
      url: "https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee"
```

If a plugin fails at build time (network error, API change, expired token, …) the build still succeeds — the value renders empty and the failure is logged in GitHub Actions output. Your site never breaks because of a flaky external API.

### 🤖 AI Plugin Builder — generate a plugin by description

Want data linkyee doesn't ship out of the box? Open the repo with [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) and describe what you want. The bundled [`linkyee-plugin-builder`](./.claude/skills/linkyee-plugin-builder/SKILL.md) skill knows the plugin contract.

**Examples:**

> *"Add a plugin that shows my 3 latest posts from medium.com/@myhandle as new links."*
>
> *"Fetch the current weather in Taipei from wttr.in and show the temp in the footer."*
>
> *"Add a plugin that pulls my Steam total playtime via the Steam Web API."*

The skill will:

1. Confirm the data source and shape with you.
2. Generate `plugins/<YourPlugin>.rb` (using the base-class HTTP/JSON/cache helpers — no raw `Net::HTTP`).
3. Wire it into `config.yml` under `plugins:` and reference the output where you asked it to appear.
4. Run `bundle exec ruby ./scaffold.rb` and verify the value rendered in `_output/index.html`.

### Developer wiki

For the full plugin contract — base-class helpers, common patterns (HTTP, JSON, scrape, cache), Liquid rendering rules, and debugging tips — read **[`plugins/README.md`](./plugins/README.md)**. It's the canonical reference the AI skill loads when it generates a plugin.

## Get Started – Deploy on GitHub Pages
### About Github Pages
> GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub, designed for creating and publishing websites directly from a GitHub repository. It allows developers, designers, and anyone with a GitHub account to host personal, project, or organizational websites without needing external hosting services. GitHub Pages works seamlessly with GitHub repositories, automatically generating a static website whenever new content is pushed.

#### Step 1. Click the “Use this template” button at the top-right corner of the [linkyee](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee) Template Repo -> “Create a new repository”:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b88da62-df4b-4f3b-a22c-e78b7527a92d)

#### Step 2. Check “Include all branches,” enter your desired GitHub Pages repo name, and click “Create repository” once finished:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3611204-7507-41a1-8221-707200a3e269)

> The GitHub Pages repo name will affect the access URL. If you enter `your-username.github.io` as the Repo Name, that will be the direct URL to your GitHub Pages site.
> If you already have a `your-username.github.io` repo, the GitHub Pages URL will be `your-username.github.io/Repo-Name`.

#### Wait for the fork to complete. You might encounter deployment errors during the initial setup due to forked repo permission issues. Let’s proceed with the steps to adjust this.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/038fac9e-83eb-4f2f-ba9a-88712b4af022)

#### Step 4. Go to Settings -> Actions -> General, ensure the following options are selected:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6851c4e6-9466-4800-862f-e9e5e5b65b11)

- Actions permissions: `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`
- Workflow permissions: `Read and write permissions`

After selecting, click the Save button to save your changes.

#### Step 5. Go to Settings -> Pages and ensure the selected branch for GitHub Pages is set to “gh-pages”:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1802bc78-4615-4d29-b180-9c84f3fb8d6d)

> 	The message `Your site is live at: XXXX` above is your public GitHub Pages access URL.

#### Step 6. Go to Settings -> Actions and wait for the first deployment to complete:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57336ef-2f35-4455-abc0-76dce07470ee)

#### Step 7. Access the GitHub Pages URL to ensure the fork was successful:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023c39f7-9351-4175-8c9f-5eb42e2ecdb9)

> Congratulations! Deployment successful. You can now modify the configuration files with your own data. 🎉🎉🎉

#### Please note that after each files modification, you need to wait for GitHub Actions to complete the `Automatic build` and `pages build and deployment` tasks.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ba637cc-3bb6-4458-a076-5f754c7429b3)

Refresh the page for the changes to take effect. 🚀

## Local testing

Build and serve the site on `http://localhost:8080`:

```bash
./preview.sh                    # build with the theme currently set in config.yml
./preview.sh minimal-mono       # temporarily switch to <theme-name>, build, serve;
                                # restores config.yml on Ctrl-C
PORT=4000 ./preview.sh          # use a different port
```

When you pass a theme argument, `preview.sh` makes a backup of your `config.yml`, switches to the requested theme for the session, and restores the original on `Ctrl-C` — your committed config is never modified.

### Auto-rebuild on save

While the preview is running, `preview.sh` watches:

- `themes/`
- `plugins/`
- `config.yml`
- `scaffold.rb`

Any change triggers an instant rebuild — just refresh the browser. Install [`fswatch`](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch) (`brew install fswatch` on macOS) for sub-second reaction; otherwise it falls back to a 1-second polling loop that works without any extra dependencies.

If a build fails (e.g. a broken Liquid reference), the watcher prints the error and keeps running — fix the issue, save again, the next save rebuilds.

### Requirements

- Ruby (`bundle install` once to fetch `liquid` and `nokogiri`)
- Python 3 (or Ruby) for the static file server `preview.sh` spawns
